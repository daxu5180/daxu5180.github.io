excerpt: "Me and my wife hiking at the Glacier National Park. We have done many hiking, offroading, and other outdoor activities across the U.S. Among the many destinations, Utah, Montana, and Alaska are my favoriate destinations so far. My wife find Big Island most attractive, I can't argue with her because I also enjoy the snorkeling expeirence and the resorts. <br/><img src='/images/Da-Bo.jpeg'>"
