Greetings! I am Da Xu, and I extend a warm welcome to my homepage. At present, I am a *Staff AI Engineer* at *LinkedIn Network Growth AI*. Prior to my current position, I was a *Machine Learning Manager* in the *Search & Recommendation team at Walmart Labs*. Over the years, I have been actively involved in driving real-world ML productions, developing foundational solutions for emerging issues, and bridging the gap between academic research and practical recommender systems (Recsys).
Some of my research efforts have been published in *NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI*, and several applicational works have been published in *KDD, WSDM, and WWW*.

My interest in Recsys and industrial ML has motivated me to explore the fundamentals of these domains. I am lucky to come across many scholars and practitioners share similar interests, which motivates me to organize events and bring together individuals to investigate various problems. Some of the events I have organized include the INFORMS session on *Causal Inference Analysis for Information Retrieval*, the 1st and 2nd *Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval (IR) and Recsys*, and the tutorials on *Theoretical Foundation of IR and Recsys* and *Advances in Simulation Technologies for Web Applications*.

While fulfilling my duties at LinkedIn is my top priority, many of the products I am involved in have broader implications for the industry and the community. Going forward, I aim to keep contributing more foundational research, joining community efforts, and writing blog posts for readers who share my interest.
