Welcome to my homepage! I am a Machine Learning Manager of the Search & Recommendation team at Walmart Labs. After joining Walmart Labs from UC Berkeley in 2018, I have been driving research and realworld productions that advance modern IR systems. In the past several years, my research works that invent theoretical tools for modern IR systems have been published in major ML/AI conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI. My industrial and application work has been published in such as KDD, WSDM, and WWW.

I am now leading a team of research scientists and ML engineers that revolutionize the IR system of Walmart.com. My team has filed several patents documenting production innovations. My contribution to the IR community has been long recognized, and I have been invited as the keynote speaker for various events in KDD, ICML, and INFORMS.

I am hornored to be designated by the INFORMS committee as the session chair of "Causal Inference Analysis for Information Retrieval" for 2021 and 2022. I am also actively engaged in public services. He organized the WSDM Workshop on "Decision Making for Information Retrieval Analysis", and the WSDM tutorial on a similar topic. I am also serving as reviewers and PC for such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD, SIGIR, WWW.
